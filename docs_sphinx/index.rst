Voronoi Features Extraction
============================

This package allows the fast extraction of Voroni features  from a set of images and includes 38 type of measurements
for each single voronoi tassel. The resulting data frame  can be used as training and testing set for  machine learning classifier

The package can be used for a variety of applications. It was originally used to measure single cell nuclei features from microscopy images
(see figure below), and for extracting infomation from maps for city density analysis and modelling
