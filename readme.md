# Voronoi Features Extraction Package


## Package documentation: https://rempic.github.io/Voronoi-Features/

## [Tutorial](./tutorial/Voronoi_Features_Tutorial.ipynb)

This package allows the fast extraction of Voroni features from a set of images and includes 38 type of measurements for each single Voronoi tassel. The resulting data frame can be used as training and testing set for machine learning classifier

The package can be used for a variety of applications. It was originally used to measure single cell nuclei features from microscopy images (see figure below), and for extracting information from maps for city density analysis and modeling
