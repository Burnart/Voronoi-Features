Image Features Extraction
============================

This package allows the fast extraction and classification of Voroni features  from a set of images. Then the resulting
table can be used as training set for a classification machine learning model

The package was originally developed to extract measurements of single cell nuclei from microscopy images
(see figure below), but it can be used to extract features from any set of images.
